<h1 align="center">Welcome to Sandy Bui's Portofolio üëã</h1>
<p>
This project was built in order to showcase what I have learned so far from my full stack bootcamp.  By the end of the course I should be able to have a final product that will display all of my work samples in a clean and professional way.  This should help employers see that I'm a fantastic candidate for their company.

## Installation

```sh
- We were not given a starter code and had to create it from scratch.
- The app needed to show my name, picture and links to sections (about me, work, and contact).
- I needed to also make sure my website can be viewed on other screens and devices with a responsive layout.
```

## Usage

```sh
- Below is a screenshot of my portfolio.
```

## Testing

```sh
- The website launched well; however, it did not have a good responsive layout. Also, I had several issues with using flexbox feature.  Thereby, I will need to speak with a tutor to understand why and improve the website.
```
